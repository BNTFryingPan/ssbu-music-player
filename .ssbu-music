// Hey, this is a file.
// This file is used by the SSBU music player to save data about certian music files.
// You can delete this file if you want, but note that it will cause songs in this folder
//     to re-normalize volume the next time you play the song.
//     this file will also be recreated again if you play music from this folder.
//     this file is also used to save the data for album pages, so if you delete it,
//     loading albums from this folder will take much longer
