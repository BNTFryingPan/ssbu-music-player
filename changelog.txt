v0.3.8
Added caching to the song list for each album. Check the readme if you have any issues with
    moving folders or songs around.

v0.3.7
Added updater, its not fully automatic
    to check for an install an update, open settings and click check for updates
    if there is an update, it will ask if you want to download it
        if you click yes, it will download and then prompt you to restart the player, which will then install the update
        if you click no, nothing will happen
    if there is no update, it says there is no update available
made version number show in title bar instead of settings screen and it pulls version number from package.json instead of hardcoded html

Tried improving twitch integration. Its still jank.
    Fixed some logic that didnt work for some reason

Disabled visualizer and normalization for now, because it causes more issues than it solves currently
    Actively looking for a fix
Made this changelog. Will probably put it in the the music player itself at some point

I should probably add changelogs for older versions, but i literally forget what was in each version lol.
look at commits if you really care that much
