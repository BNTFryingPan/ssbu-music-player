v0.4.0
Will now load from files defined in Music/folders.ssbu-music
    Lines in that file that start with any of the following characters will be ignored: ['#', '//', '$', '!', '-']
    Lines that start with "%" will tell it to recusively load songs in subfolders of that folder
Moved some buttons around in settings to make it look a *little* better. I really need to work on that at some point though
Changed the volume slider to be non-linear. The slider and output volume ranges from 0 to 1, and the slider volume it put 
    into the equation x^3 before being given to the output. This allows finer control of volume at lower levels, but less
    at higher levels, although it doesnt really matter because humans hear volume non-lineraly. google it if you care enough
    i do want feedback on this though, so if you feel it should be adjusted, just make a github issue with want you want out
    of the volume slider.
Changed some layout things that should not be noticable, but should slightly improve performace (removed some spacer elements
    that didnt actually do anything and removed some calcs in css to improve performance)
Changed the minimum size of the window to 550px by 475px to help stop scaling issues at really small window sizes
Also changed the default size of the window to 600px by 900px to also help with certain scaling issues at the default size
Changed the look of the scrollbar and music control sliders a bit
Made the music control buttons have images instead of text, and adjusted css of the buttons a bit too, and the pause button
    now changes based on if the player is paused or not
Added a message that displays if you have no music when you open the music menu telling you to either put music in the music
    folder, or to add directories to look for music in.
Music list caching now updates whenever you open an album in the background, and will reload the song list if there are any
    changes
Added global keybind listeners for media control buttons to stop music, pause/play music, skip track, and previous track.
    might make the stop music button do something different, but for now ive got no ideas (not sure what the point of stop
    is anyways lol)

At some point i added rich presence assets for more albums i listen to. heres a full list:
[
    "A Hat in Time OST", "Celeste (Original Soundtrack)", "Celeste: Farewell (Original Soundtrack)", "UNDERTALE Soundtrack",
    "Portal 2: Songs to Test By - Volume 1", "Portal 2: Songs to Test By - Volume 2", "Hexoscope OST", "Aperture Tag OST",
    "Portal 2: Songs to Test By - Volume 3", "Portal 2: Songs to Test By", "Terraria Soundtrack Volume 1", "Astroneer",
    "Terraria Soundtrack Volume 2", "Terraria Soundtrack Volume 3", "Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes - OST", "Portal",
    "Astroneer (original game soundtrack) Volume 2", "Subnautica Original Soundtrack",  
]
If you want any that are not already here, please make a github issue and provide a list of names you want converted to
    that album image (for example "Portal 2: Songs to Test By" and "Portal 2: Songs to Test By - Volume 1" have the same
    album image), and either upload or link to an image that is at least 512x512 (1024x1024 recommended) and is in .png,
    .jpg, or .jpeg format (that is what discord wants and needs for a rich presence asset). You can also look at
    music-player.js for an up-to-date list, although it may be for an unreleased version.

v0.3.9
Moved some files around internally to be more organized
Changed the look of the scrollbar. Having a lot of songs in All Songs may make performace bad. oh well.
changed some css to make it look a little bit better and scale a bit better when resizing the window.

v0.3.8
Added caching to the song list for each album. Check the readme if you have any issues with
    moving folders or songs around.

v0.3.7
Added updater, its not fully automatic
    to check for an install an update, open settings and click check for updates
    if there is an update, it will ask if you want to download it
        if you click yes, it will download and then prompt you to restart the player, which will then install the update
        if you click no, nothing will happen
    if there is no update, it says there is no update available
made version number show in title bar instead of settings screen and it pulls version number from package.json instead of
    hardcoded html

v0.3.1 - v0.3.5
literally just testing updater, so i skipped to 0.3.7 bc i can lol

v0.3.0
Added Discord Rich Presence
    Shows playing song, shuffle mode, and playback state
    Album, track, time playing the song
    Shows song source (youtube, local file, etc...)
    Shows album art for select albums. Look in SupportedAlbumArts.txt for a list
    Added album art for A Hat in Time OST, Celeste OST (and Farewell), and Undertale OST
    Shows artist on the large image
Tried improving twitch integration. Its still jank.
    Fixed some logic that didnt work for some reason
    attempted to make automatic song announcements (will be a setting, but it doesnt work anyways lol)
Disabled visualizer and normalization for now, because it causes more issues than it solves currently
    Actively looking for a fix
Made this changelog. Will probably put it in the the music player itself at some point

I should probably add changelogs for older versions, but i literally forget what was in each version lol.
look at commits if you really care that much
