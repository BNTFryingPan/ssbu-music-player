# ssbu-music-player
A music player that has a UI based on the UI of the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate music interface.

Currently only optimized and tested on Windows 10, should work on older versions of windows, known to at least start on Ubuntu, but not tested very much.

Im not creating these as gh issues for now because im not focusing on ubuntu developmenet for now
Known issues on Ubuntu:
Fails to install with default package setup (mainly ewc causing issues, as it only works on windows)
Window icons (close, minimize, maximie) dont render correctly, as the font is windows exclusive as far as i know (Seoge UI)
Title bar is rendered what appears to be 100% its height below where it should be. (it looks like there is an invisible title bar above it basically, but i dont think thats actually what the issue is)

music might not even play on ubuntu because i didnt have any music on my ubuntu install, and was too lazy to get some.

if you have a mac and want to test and develop for it, go ahead, but i cant and wont help. i dont own a mac
